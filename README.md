# Love-Maths

## Welcome to Love-Maths project for Code Institute Course work.

### Initialization

At the begining of the project, a repository was created and initialised with the Code Institutes template.

Using VS Code desktop, index.html was created with links to style.css, fontawesome fonts, google font 'Raleway' and Script.js files.

It was decided a link to Boot-Strap should also be included for its many benefits but mainly the ease of its grid system but it was never used.

### Wire-Framing

It is important to visualize how the site should look from the begining, so an image was taken of the required wire-frame layout and worked on.

The Wire-Frame image sets out how the site should look when finished and sets zones by ID or Class so these parts can be targeted later.

At this point forward work on the site should take in to consideration a Mobile-First concept so it is imagined what the site will look like on different screen sizes.

### Documentation

It was decided early that work would start on the README.md file and be updated as processes were started and completed.

All code throughout the project should contain comments to explain each code snippets use this some aspects of this will add to the projects documentation later.

Other documentation may include git commits, Agile concepts such as Sprints, Userstories and iteration.

### Responsive Design

Begining with mobile first methodology during the build it was found that the page content fit most screen sizes well only having a slight problem when in tablet view the game type buttons would over lap...

- Bootstrap and flex-box to stop button over lay.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
